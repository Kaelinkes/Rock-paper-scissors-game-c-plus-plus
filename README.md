## 🧠 How It Works

1. The player selects:
   - `1` for Rock  
   - `2` for Paper  
   - `3` for Scissors  

2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.

3. The game compares both choices and determines:
   - **You win**
   - **Computer wins**
   - **Draw**

4. The player can choose to play again or exit.
